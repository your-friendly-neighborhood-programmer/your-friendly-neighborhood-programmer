ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Victoria!

Iâ€™m a self-employed freelance software engineer whoâ€™s as comfortable debugging code as I am exploring the human psyche (thanks to my BS in Applied Psychology with a concentration in Media & Technology)! Currently, Iâ€™m halfway through an MS in Data Scienceâ€”because why not mix numbers with neurons? When Iâ€™m not refactoring my Python, JavaScript, R, or SQL skills (or tinkering with React and prompt engineering), Iâ€™m probably lost in a world where algorithms and witty code comments collide. If you need someone who can turn data into insightâ€”and humor into horsepowerâ€”hit me up!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on strengthening my React skills
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about neural networks
